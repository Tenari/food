  <h1>As a Customer</h1>
  <p>You place an order. All online chefs see the order. They decide if they want to take your order. Hopefully one of them does. They grab it, they make it, they take it, and you eat it. Be sure to tip well.</p>
  <h1>As a Chef</h1>
  <p>You make an account. You immediatley start seeing orders. As soon as you see one you like, take it, make it, deliver it, and get paid.</p>
